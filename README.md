# DL_Projects
Repository of the different Deep Learning projects that I'm working on in my spare time. The projects are mostly focused on Computer Vision applications.

For the projects I use the Keras framework with the Theano framworks as backend.

Currently looking into trying out different type of GAN networks, as well as verification and segmentation networks (e.g. siamese networks and UNet)
